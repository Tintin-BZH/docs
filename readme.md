# Welcome

Warthog is an experimental L1-cryptocurrency implementation without specific focus. This project is not a dumb fork of something else. It was developed completely from scratch!

Warthog's *Janushash* mining algorithm is unique across the crypto space, it is the world's first [Proof of Balanced Work (PoBW) algorithm](https://github.com/CoinFuMasterShifu/ProofOfBalancedWork/blob/main/PoBW.pdf), which requires CPU and GPU hash power for mining.

The [core repository](https://github.com/warthog-network) offers two applications:
* Node
* Command line Wallet

Furthermore there are two third-party wallets:
* [Wart-dapp](https://github.com/warthog-network/wart-dapp) (open source)
* [wart-wallet](https://github.com/warthog-network/wart-wallet) (open source)

You can join the Warthog community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QMDV8bGTdQ).

- [wart-wallet (CLI)](https://github.com/Tintin-BZH/docs/blob/master/Guides/wart-wallet.md)


## Mining
Mining Warthog's Janushash algorithm requires both, a good CPU and a GPU.
