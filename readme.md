# Welcome

Warthog is an experimental cryptocurrency with world's first Proof of Balanced Work algorithm written by a group of crypto enthusiasts. It is meant to be a community effort and everyone is more than welcome to join and contribute. Who knows how big this project will be? This project is not a dumb fork of something else. It was developed completely from scratch!

Warthog's *Janushash* mining algorithm is unique across the crypto space, it is the world's first [Proof of Balanced Work (PoBW) algorithm](https://github.com/CoinFuMasterShifu/ProofOfBalancedWork/blob/main/PoBW.pdf), which requires CPU and GPU hash power for mining.

The [core repository](https://github.com/warthog-network) offers two applications:
* Node
* Command line Wallet

Furthermore there are two third-party wallets:
* [Wart-dapp](https://github.com/warthog-network/wart-dapp) (open source)
* [wart-wallet](https://github.com/warthog-network/wart-wallet) (open source)

## Mining
Mining Warthog's Janushash algorithm requires both, a good CPU and a GPU.
